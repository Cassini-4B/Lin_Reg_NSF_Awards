<AbstractNarration>This award supports participation in the research conference "Frontier Probability Days" to be held at Oregon State University, March 29 - 31, 2018. The meeting brings together leading regional and national researchers, graduate students, and other scientists interested in probability theory and its applications, to stimulate research activities in this area and foster new interdisciplinary collaborations.  A special feature of the conference is its attention to "applications of probability". Part of the intent of the meeting is to help broaden interaction with other fields, a source of inspiration for both more applied and theoretical aspects of probability research. Much of the support in this award is allocated to travel support for students and early-career researchers, for whom the conference represents an excellent opportunity to stay informed of recent research progress and to initiate research collaborations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This meeting is the sixth in a series that meets approximately every two years in the Inter-mountain West of the United States. The format consists of ten plenary talks and several shorter presentations. The plenary speakers represent a spectrum of leading work in both theoretical and applied probability. Approximately fifty non-local participants are expected to participate in the conference. Topics of interest include random graphs, stochastic partial differential equations, stochastic networks, and probabilistic applications to biology and dynamical systems. More details can be found at the conference web site:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;http://math.oregonstate.edu/~kovchegy/FPD2018/&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
