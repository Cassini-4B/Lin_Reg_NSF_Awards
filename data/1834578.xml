<AbstractNarration>This award supports participation in the international conference "Pure and Applied Model Theory" taking place October 25-28, 2018 at the University of Illinois at Chicago. The subject of the conference is model theory, with an emphasis on connections between deep results in pure model theory and applications. Several talks will also touch on connections to algebra, analysis, combinatorics, number theory, infinitary logic, and descriptive set theory. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference will feature more than twenty talks by leaders in the field. This meeting provides an opportunity for interactions among U.S. and European model theorists, with multiple benefits for both. In addition to the talks, graduate students and junior researchers in attendance will have the opportunity to disseminate their research through a poster session. Financial support to attend the conference will preferentially be given to graduate students, postdoctoral associates, and junior faculty who may not otherwise be able to attend the conference.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
