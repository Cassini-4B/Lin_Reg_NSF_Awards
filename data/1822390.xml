<AbstractNarration>The 30th Cumberland Conference on Combinatorics, Graph Theory and Computing will be held at Marshall University, May 19-20, 2018.  This is the latest in a series of conferences, usually held annually, that provide a venue for students and researchers, particularly but not exclusively from the southeastern United States, to discuss the latest advances in discrete mathematics and computer science.  Discrete mathematics is a rapidly expanding field with applications in communication, network and information science, life sciences and engineering.  The conference will promote applications of discrete mathematics in computer science and encourage participation by students and groups underrepresented in mathematics.  It provides a setting where researchers at all levels can present their work, exchange information and collaborate on solving problems.  It strengthens the regional network of researchers while connecting that network to broader national and international communities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference scope includes all areas of discrete mathematics.  Four featured internationally-known speakers will give 50-minute plenary presentations.  Estimated attendance is around 100 participants, and about 60 contributed 20-minute talks are planned.  Abstracts from the conference will be available indefinitely through a conference abstracts service.  Funding from this award will support travel, accommodation and meal expenses for the featured speakers, and other participants identified through a selection process.  The selection process will prioritize women, members of underrepresented minorities, people with disabilities, early-career mathematicians, and researchers without federal funding. The conference website is http://www.marshall.edu/math/cumberland2018/&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
