<AbstractNarration>This award supports the participation of U.S.-based mathematical scientists in scientific activities held at the Fields Institute for Research in Mathematical Sciences. The direct impact of NSF funding consists of contributing to the training of a considerable number of junior U.S. researchers (early-career faculty, postdoctoral fellows, and graduate students), who are given the opportunity to participate in activities at the Fields Institute. The primary activities of the Fields Institute -- Thematic and Focus Programs -- are extended periods of deep research concentration on topics of current research interest in the mathematical sciences. These range from one to six months in length and involve long- and short-term visitors, postdoctoral fellows, and students; the programs include workshops and seminars, distinguished lectures, and graduate courses. Program organizers strive to ensure strong participation by women, minorities, and other groups traditionally underrepresented in the mathematical sciences. The activities bring together world leaders, industrial partners, and researchers for sustained periods of communication and collaboration, leading to rapid progress on problems of great current significance, enhanced global research networks, and increased interdisciplinary research. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project supports the participation of U.S.-based mathematicians and statisticians in activities held at the Fields Institute for Research in Mathematical Sciences.  Funded programs are assured to be of the highest caliber, as rated by the Institute's Scientific Advisory Panel. The Fields Institute's means of dissemination, including publications, website, live online webcasting, and video archiving, contribute towards wide communication of the scientific results arising from the activities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
