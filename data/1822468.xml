<AbstractNarration>This award supports US participation in a meeting of the Canadian Number Theory Association. The Canadian Number Theory Association (CNTA) was founded in 1987 at the International Number Theory Conference at Universite Laval, for the purpose of enhancing and promoting learning and research in number theory in Canada and beyond. To advance these goals,  the CNTA organizes biannual conferences that exhibit new research in number theory, with the aim of exposing Canadian and international students and researchers to the latest developments in the field. This year CNTA XV will be held in Quebec City, July 9-13 2018, with further information available at &lt;br/&gt;http://archimede.mat.ulaval.ca/CNTA2018/. The CNTA meetings are among the largest number theory conferences in the world, rivaled in size only by the biannual Journees Arithmetiques which take place in years alternating with the CNTA meetings, usually in southern Europe. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The format of CNTA XV will follow the general tradition of the CNTA meetings. It will be a 5-day conference featuring 8 hour-long plenary lectures, one of which will be given by the winner of the 2018 Ribenboim Prize for Distinguished Research in Number Theory, awarded at the meeting; 20 half-hour invited lectures; more than 40 contributed talks of 20 minutes each, delivered in up to four parallel sessions; and a public lecture directed to the general public and free of charge. Talks at CNTA meetings will cover topics in algebraic number theory, analytic number theory, computational and algorithmic number theory, arithmetic geometry, representation theory, automorphic forms, diophantine approximation, and other areas belonging or related to number theory. A call for contributed talks is forthcoming; interested speakers will submit brief abstracts which will be reviewed for suitability by the Scientific Committee. Selected speakers for contributed talks will range from young participants to well-known number theorists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
