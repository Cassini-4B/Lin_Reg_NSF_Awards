<AbstractNarration>The Cincinnati Symposium on Probability Theory and Applications 2018 will be held November 9 to 11, 2018 at the University of Cincinnati. The symposium will bring together junior and senior researchers working at the forefront of random matrix theory and stochastic processes.  Results from these fields are increasingly used throughout the sciences and other areas of mathematics with direct applications including finance, insurance, statistics, number theory, and combinatorics.  By connecting a broad array of researchers at different career stages with expertise in a variety of innovative techniques, the symposium will help foster the development of the mathematical theory of these fields.  Professional development of the next generation of probabilists is a major focus of the symposium by providing early-stage researchers opportunities to present their work in talks and a poster session.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recently developed techniques in random matrix theory and stochastic processes have led to many significant advances.  As the scope of these fields expands, further progress is increasingly dependent on the combination of ideas from multiple areas. In order to break down barriers between researchers working with different tools and to foster new collaborations at the frontiers of these fields, the symposium will bring together experts working in several related areas.  Topics from random matrix theory will include universal probability distributions, martingale techniques, and integrable probability, while those from stochastic processes will include Brownian excursions and combinatorial stochastic processes, stochastic partial differential equations, and infinitely-divisible processes.  By connecting junior and senior probabilists using different methods, the symposium will help build bridges between areas and stimulate new cross-disciplinary investigations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Symposium website:  http://homepages.uc.edu/~buckinrt/cinciprob2018/&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
