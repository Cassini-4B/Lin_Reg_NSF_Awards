<AbstractNarration>The Historically Black Colleges and Universities Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP) through Targeted Infusion Projects supports the development, implementation, and study of evidence-based innovative models and approaches for improving the preparation and success of HBCU undergraduate students so that they may pursue science, technology, engineering or mathematics (STEM) graduate programs and/or careers. The project at Clark Atlanta University seeks to improve students' mastery and use of mathematical concepts through course redesign, assessment, and implementation of evidence-based teaching strategies. Undergraduate students are involved in the project as researchers and supplemental instruction leaders.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project has the objectives to: redesign and implement a one-semester Pre-Calculus course; implement active learning courseware in Pre-Calculus and Calculus I courses; conduct student enhancement training; institute a supplemental instruction program; and conduct faculty development. School of Education faculty participate in the project by assessing and studying which intervention or combination thereof is most effective. This new approach is designed to improve the quality of STEM education for all undergraduate STEM majors, thus increasing the minority STEM talent pool of rigorously prepared students for the workforce, graduate or professional school.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
