# Lin_Reg_NSF_Awards
Project 2: Linear Regression of NSF Award Statistics


This is my second project for the Metis Data Science Bootcamp.  I am looking at award duration, abstract length, state, 
institution and award histories and fitting these features to a Linear Regression Model to determine if there is any
way to predict funding amount.
