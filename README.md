# Lin_Reg_NSF_Awards
## Project 2: Linear Regression of NSF (National Science Foundation) Award Statistics


This is my second project for the Metis Data Science Bootcamp.  I am looking at award duration, abstract length, state, 
institution and award histories and fitting these features to a Linear Regression Model to determine if there is any
way to predict NSF grant funding amount.  

## Summary of Steps
1) Attempted to scrape NSF Award website(https://dellweb.bfa.nsf.gov/) with BeautifulSoup and Selenium
2) Downloaded Award summaries and Award histories by year
3) Performed data clean up: dealt with NaN's, merged data frames, added dummy variables for categorical features.
4) Fit data to linear regression, Lasso and Ridge models.
5) Analyzed results.
6) Looked at model diagnostics.
7) Adjusted model to achieve better results.
